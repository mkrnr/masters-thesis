\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future-work}
\itodo{sorting of PDFs into different categories (very well suited for extraction or not suited)}
\itodo{usage of available meta data about the paper (e.g.\ conference/journal title), e.g.\ to learn different models}
\itodo{add more labels and data from distant supervision, e.g.\ title, year, conference\dots}
\itodo{handling special case with dash in name, line break (consider Hans-Peter vs Mich-ael),--- or ``ders.'' instead of name,\dots}
\itodo{expand j in Generalized Expectation to include context (+ implementation)}
\itodo{implementation: storing of learned model}
\itodo{segmentation into reference strings: using year as anchor?\citep{powley2007high}}
\itodo{evaluate impact of features (see \citep{bellare2007learning})}
\itodo{higher order crf to handle line breaks (currently kicked out)}
