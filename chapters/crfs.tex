\chapter{Conditional Random Fields}\label{cha:crfs}

As we discussed in the previous chapter, \glspl{crf} are widely used in the related work for learning probabilistic models on given data.
In this chapter we give an introduction to this framework.
First we provide a background in probability theory and graphical models.
In addition to relevant definitions we will use a simplified example that is based on the extraction of author information from reference strings in research papers.\\


\section{Probability Theory}\label{sec:probability-theory}
Numerous concepts in probability theory are crucial for an understanding of \glspl{crf}.
The notion of \glspl{probability distribution} is one such concept.
A \gls{probability distribution} $P$ is defined over $(\glssymbol{outcome space},\glssymbol{measurable set})$ where \glssymbol{outcome space} is the \gls{outcome space} and \glssymbol{measurable set} is a \gls{measurable set} of \glspl{event} \citep{koller2009probabilistic}.
$P$ describes a mapping from events in \glssymbol{measurable set} to real values according to the following rules \citep{koller2009probabilistic}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $P(\alpha)\geq 0 $ for all $ \alpha \in S$.
  \item $P(\glssymbol{outcome space})=1$.
  \item If $\alpha,\beta\in \glssymbol{outcome space}$ and $\alpha\cap\beta = \emptyset$, then $P(\alpha\cup\beta)=P(\alpha)+P(\beta)$.
\end{itemize}

In our example of author information extraction we can define \glssymbol{outcome space} as the set of all possible words that can appear in a specific position in a paper.
The elements of \glssymbol{measurable set} are subsets

% author example

Based on the idea of \glspl{probability distribution}, a \gls{random variable} is a \gls{function} that associates with each outcome in \glssymbol{outcome space} a value.
