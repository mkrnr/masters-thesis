\chapter{Implementation}\label{cha:implementation}

In this chapter we will discuss our implementation of author extraction using \glspl{crf} with \gls{ge} applied on a distantly supervised training set.
Our approach can be separated into a number of steps.
One of the first steps is to generate data sets on author names that are used as knowledge bases for the \gls{distant supervision} (\Cref{sec:knowledge-bases}).
Another initial step is to extract the content of a set of research papers given in the \gls{pdf} format.
Since we currently focus on the papers' reference section, we will discuss a heuristic for identifying and extracting reference sections.
We then focus on the annotation of authors in the extracted reference sections using our knowledge base.
From this annotations we then generate \gls{ge} constraints on a word level.
Using the extracted reference sections as unlabeled training data together with the \gls{ge} constraints we can perform a \gls{crf} training.
