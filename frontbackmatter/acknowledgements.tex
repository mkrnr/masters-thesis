\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

I wish to thank, first and foremost, my advisers Ren\'e Pickhardt and Steffen Staab for their combined guidance during my research.
This thesis benefited from both their expertise and would not have been possible without their support.
Steffen Staab also suggested the usage of conditional random fields in combination with distant supervision for the author extraction problem.

Next, I want to thank Zeljko Carevic for his discussions and for providing the Sowiport dataset.
I also want to thank Daniel Janke for his outstanding support regarding the evaluation servers.

Special thanks to Michael Ruster, Stefan Becker, Melanie Koloseike, and Kevin Keul for proofreading this thesis.

Last but not least, I want to thank my family and friends for the endless support and motivation throughout my study.
